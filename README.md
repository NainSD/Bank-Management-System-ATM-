# Bank-Management-System-ATM-
In this project I used java swing, jdbc and awt features to make frames where all the functionality will operate like Automated Teller Machine(ATM). I used MySQL workbench to store datas and connect it with code.
Functionalities of this project:
1.In login page, you can you have options for clear, signup or signin.
2.By clicking signup you can create account in the system and a pin and card number will be given which will be stored in the database.
3.After sign up, with the given pin and cardnumber you can login to the system.
4.In this system, you will see an ATM interface where you have 6 operational buttons for differents tasks e.g. cashout, withdrawl, deposit, fastcash, mini-statement, pin change, balance enquiry and a back/exit button to get back to previous page.
5.All the actions after login, will be stored in database and updated accordingly with time date. e.g. If you deposit/withdraw money that will be updated with previous balance and set to new one with date and time in the database.
6.There is a prompt message that will indicate after each action is done and taken back to main transaction frame.
